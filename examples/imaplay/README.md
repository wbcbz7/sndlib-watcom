# sndlib->ima adpcm wave player

plays IMA ADPCM-compressed .wav files. intended for 486 and early Pentiums.

currently in alpha, completely untested, buggy on mono files, might crash at any moment. you know :)

TODO: more documentation, see source/makefile for now. basically you need to add mp2play folder to include path and link with `imaplay.lib`
